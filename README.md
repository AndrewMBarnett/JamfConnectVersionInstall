# Jamf Connect Version Install
Downloads and installs the latest available Jamf Connect software for Mac directly on the client or you can target a specific version you want. This avoids having to manually download and store an up-to-date installer on a distribution server every month.

I wanted to be able to download certain version of Jamf Connect without having to download the package from the website. This original script was created by William Smith and I added in some updates to be able to add in some more logging along with version targeting.
